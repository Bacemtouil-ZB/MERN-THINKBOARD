# 🧠 MERN ThinkBoard – Notes App

Welcome to **MERN ThinkBoard** — my first full-stack notes app built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node). This project helped me learn how full-stack applications work, including how to build REST APIs, connect databases, and deploy apps online.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧱 **Full-Stack App** – Built with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js
- ✨ **CRUD Notes** – Create, update, and delete notes with title and description
- ⚙️ **Rate Limiting** – Implemented using Upstash Redis to avoid spamming the API
- 🧪 **.env Configuration** – Easy-to-use environment variables for secrets
- 🌐 **Responsive UI** – Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- 📦 **Deployment Ready** – Clean structure and ready to publish
- 🧰 **Beginner Friendly** – Designed while learning the MERN stack step by step

## 🔧 Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Create a `.env` file with the following content:
```env
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_redis_token
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5001
```

3. Install dependencies and run the server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 💻 Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies and run the development server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## 🌍 Production Deployment

In production, the frontend will make API requests to the same domain using a relative path (`/api`), based on this logic:

```js
const BASE_URL =
  import.meta.env.MODE === "development"
    ? "http://localhost:5001/api"
    : "/api";
```

This makes the app compatible with hosting on platforms like Render, Vercel, or using Netlify for frontend + Render for backend.
